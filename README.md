# polly-pipeline
This repository is an improved version of Polly. We have extended different passes so that it can detect pipeline patterns in a program. It is done by finding cross-loop task parallelism between iteration blocks of different for-loop nests. For more detailed information, please refer to our paper "A pipeline detection technique in Polly".
